E-wee-ctor is a educational purpose project to make a tiny [Effector](https://github.com/zerobias/effector) ☄️-like library

## Highlights

- Purpose of this project is to learn and to teach, how Effector works
- This is **NOT** production-ready library, and _never will be_
- Name "eweector" is derived from "effector" and "wee", meaning "little, small, tiny"
- Second meaning of "wee" is also fit
- Also my name is Victor and I like how eweector sounds :)
- I plan to write article/s about this project, stay tuned
